*  if you already have ohmyzsh and all of the required plugins installed, 
   you can just add sam.zsh-theme to ~/ohmyzsh/themes

otherwise 
1. add the files in the "script" folder to your root/home directory
2. make sure that you have zsh and git installed
3. execute "chmod +755 runner.sh script.sh"   (so the scripts have permission to execute)
4. execute runner.sh   (./runner.sh)
everything should install properly after that
