 *  if you already have ohmyzsh and all the theme plugins installed, 
    you can just add sam.zsh-theme to ~/ohmyzsh/themes

otherwise:
1.  add the files in the "script" folder to /~
2.  install zsh and git if you haven't already
3.  give the scripts permission to run (chmod +755 runner.sh script.sh)
4.  execute runner.sh   (./runner.sh)
